# DS_Heap_Sort
Heap sort can be understood as the improved version of the binary search tree.
It does not create a node as in case of binary search tree instead it builds the heap by adjusting the position of elements within the array itself.
An ordered balanced binary tree is called a max heap where the value at the root of any subtree is more than or equal to the value of either if its children.
Basically, there are two phases involved in the sorting of elements using heap sort algorithm they are as follows:- 
1. First,start with the construction of a heap by adjusting the array elements.
2. Once the heap is created repeatedly eliminate the root element of the heap by shifting it to the end of the array and then store the heap structure with remaining elements.
